## What exactly is the “SteppingEffects” and what can you do with it?

SteppingEffects was my idea for Halloween. A nice and simple script that can spawn objects on every 
step you take. It was inspired by the forest god from the Ghibli movie "Princess Mononoke". When he 
takes a step he creates flora that dies off in a second.

You can see this script in action here:
(And no, the dying people are not part of this script, just a gimmick for Halloween)

## Requirements

- Onesync


## Features

- Spawns objects on every step you take.
- Synced to other clients using state bags.
- Needs to be toggled using a command. (restricted to players with permissions)
- Configurable values like objects to spawn and light settings in client and server.lua.


## Performance

- Abysmal. Let’s not talk about it.
- Idle 0.00ms but you can get up to 0.20ms per player.
- If you have ideas on how to further improve this, let me know.
- This was mostly thought of as a nice “gimmick” and maybe something for video recording :)
